  Engaging in loss making jobs for fixed fees is a major problem in
  consulting, particularly in the competitive construction industry. This
  thesis investigates whether machine learning techniques applied to a
  company's passively collected internal data could help avoid loss making
  jobs or help tactfully choose when to enforce stricter contracts. It was
  found that in a specific decision framework, a case study's profits
  could be improved 9\% by declining approximately 4\% of projects.
  Alternative decision frameworks are also proposed and evaluated.
  Algorithmic methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Boosted
  Trees, Naive Bayes, and Bayesian Networks were applied as well as
  blended combinations of these methods. A decision scenario which
  rejected projects above a sequence of tested thresholds was run in order
  to find the optimal threshold for profit improvements. The blended
  Logistic Regression model outperformed other methods and produced a 95\%
  confidence interval of 6.5 - 11.5\% profit improvements. The findings
  from this research have the potential to assist managers in reducing
  losses by highlighting risky projects and guiding project-based changes
  to fee structures.

\section{1. Introduction}\label{introduction}

Clearly state the research question and objectives of the work. Briefly
provide any necessary background to frame the research question.
Concisely summarize the major findings/results. Summary of Key Related
Research This section should include a brief summary of key related
research. Emphasis should be on demonstrating the foundation for the
current investigation. Specifically, the goal is to clearly delineate a
gap or missing link that the current research fills. Authors should
avoid presenting a litany of past research and should focus on prior
work necessary to demonstrate the existence of the research gap
addressed in the manuscript.
